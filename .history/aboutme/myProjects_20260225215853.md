# Maze Runner

## Description
A C# console-based game where the player has to collect all coins to win while avoiding or stunning the enemies.

> I used **Visual Studio 2022** for this project.

## Code Snippets
### Main Menu of the Game

```c#
Console.WriteLine("===========================================");
Console.WriteLine("             MAZE RUNNER GAME  ");
Console.WriteLine("===========================================");
Console.WriteLine();

Console.WriteLine("INSTRUCTIONS:");
Console.WriteLine("─────────────");
Console.WriteLine("W/A/S/D      - Move Player (@)");
Console.WriteLine("ARROW KEYS   - Shoot Bullets (*)");
Console.WriteLine("ESC          - Quit Game");
Console.WriteLine();

Console.WriteLine("OBJECTIVE:");
Console.WriteLine("─────────────");
Console.WriteLine("- Collect all coins ($) to win!");
Console.WriteLine("- Avoid or stun enemies (E)");
Console.WriteLine("- You have 3 lives");
Console.WriteLine("- Shooting an enemy stuns it temporarily");
Console.WriteLine();

Console.WriteLine("Press any key to start...");
Console.ReadKey(true);
```
### Validating Character Movement

```c#
static void handleinput(ConsoleKeyInfo key)
{
    // store current position to check if movement is valid
     Int32 newx = player_x;
    Int32 newy = player_y;

    // === 1. MOVEMENT CONTROLS ===
    // WASD keys to move the player 
    if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.W)
    {
        newy--;
    }
    else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.S)
    {
        newy++;
    }
    else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.A)
    {
        newx--;
    }
    else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.D)
    {
        newx++;
    }
    else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.Escape)
    {
        gamerunning = false; // quit game
        return;
    }

    // === 2. SHOOTING CONTROLS ===
    // arrow keys shoot bullets in four directions
    if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.UpArrow)
    {
        addbullet(player_x, player_y - 1, 0, -1); // shoot up
    }
    else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.DownArrow)
    {
        addbullet(player_x, player_y + 1, 0, 1); // shoot down
    }
    else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.LeftArrow)
    {
        addbullet(player_x - 1, player_y, -1, 0); // shoot left
    }
    else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.RightArrow)
    {
        addbullet(player_x + 1, player_y, 1, 0); // shoot right
    }

    // === 3. VALIDATE MOVEMENT ===
    // only move player if position changed and destination is not a wall
    if (newx != player_x || newy != player_y)
    {
        // check if new position is not a wall
        if (maze[newy, newx] != wall)
        {
            // check if player is collecting a coin
            if (maze[newy, newx] == coin)
            {
                score += 10;
                totalcoins--;
                maze[newy, newx] = empty; // remove coin from maze
            }
            // move player to new position
            player_x = newx;
            player_y = newy;
        }

    }
}
```

## What I Learned
What I learned about this project is how to take user inputation to the next level by reading the applied keys specific to the character movement or actions and updating them in the program. I also learned more about methods and how they organize the code in an efficient way as well as returning values depending on the method type.

            Gym-goers all over the world push their limits, sweating it out for hours in pursuit of their fitness goals. Yet, once training is over, many face their toughest challenge outside the gym walls. Fast food joints, conveniently and dangerously located nearby, trigger a moment of vulnerability, when hunger is at its peak and willpower at its lowest.
            To solve this, we designed the first menu created for that very specific moment. A meal packed with nutrition, but without sacrificing taste. Flavor-rich, satisfying, engineered to fuel recovery, and launched only where it’s needed the most.
